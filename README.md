# MTB-kartta_Mapnik_styles
Mapnik render styles for mountain biking, originally based on OSM Bright.

Subfolders include separate tile rendering rules for path+tracks+labels and background (everything except labels + paths (including footways, bridleways etc.) and tracks). 

'MTB-kartta_polut-talvi' currently non-functional, needs to be adjusted after fixing 'MTB-kartta_polut'.
